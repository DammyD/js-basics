# Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

- A statically typed language is a programming language that checks variable type at compile time. In this type of language the variable type must be declared before use and cannot be change during program's execution. e.g. C, C++, Java.

- A Dynamically typed language is a programming language that checks variable type at run time. The varaible type doesn't need to be declared before use and can be changed at any time during program's execution. e.g. Python, JavaScript, Ruby.

# Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&
                              
- Null is a variable tha has been explicitly assigned the null value while Undefined is a variable that has not been assigned a value yet.

let x;
console.log(x); // Output: x is undefined

let y == null;
console.log(y); // Output:  y is null
